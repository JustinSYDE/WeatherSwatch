TO DO
=====

##Changing cities on select tab
* Create random generator with string array of city names
* Bind tabs with string from controller
* Pass string variable (city name) to AJAX call

##Auto copy to clipboard
* ZeroClipboard? Are there any other alternatives?
* Change background colour of message to colour of selected swatch

##Modularize Application
* Use ng-view:
	* [View 1]: Colour swatch
	* [View 2]: Copied message
* RequireJS for practice
* Separate into services:
	* [Service 1]: Tab service
	* [Service 2]: Swatch service
* Simplify controllers so they are minimal
