#What is Weather Swatch?

Need a little inspiration for the color scheme of your website?
Weather Swatch generates a collection of color swatches based on the current weather conditions in a specific city.

#Why weather + color swatches?

The story goes as follows: when I first moved away from home, I was doing a freelance webdesign project for another company as well. I couldn't think of a color scheme to use that seemed fitting. I thought about what the weather was probably like back home in Toronto (it was around Fall) and a Torontonian fall color scheme hit me! 

Remember, inspiration can come from anywhere! 
And if you're like me, the weather might help spring some inspiration on color schemes!
